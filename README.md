# Sensor-Fault-Detection

### Problem Statement

The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force
a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of
a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.

This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by 
a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.
